\chapter{Security battlecards}
\label{app:battlecards}

These battlecards contain brief descriptions supplemented with my personal opinion on security tools that are recommended for use in the paved path methodology.

\battlecard{SonarLint by SonarSource}{\url{https://www.sonarlint.org/}}{
\label{bc:sonarlint}
SonarLint is a free IDE plugin that focuses on code quality. As explained in this work code quality and code security are often related and hence some rules exist in SonarLint that target security rules. SonarLint is developer-friendly as it provides quick-fixes and clear descriptions with small code examples. However, it only provides a small number of security rules and the rules are not easily customized.}{Lint}

\battlecard{Snyk Open Source}{\url{https://snyk.io/}}{
\label{bc:snyk}
Snyk Open Source tests for vulnerabilities in open source dependencies. It is available in several IDE's but its web view is the most useful. Snyk Open Source provides remediation through automated pull requests to bump the dependency to the latest version.}{SCA}
