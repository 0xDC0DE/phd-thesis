\section{Release}

High velocity of development and delivery, is most easily achieved in \gls{saas} and other cloud computing delivery models.
It is easier to push frequent updates if there is only a single version of the application, hosted it centrally and managed by the software provider.
Furthermore, because the service provider has access to user data and behaviour it is easier to collect feedback and make incremental improvements.
Finally, it is more economically viable to adapt to continuously changing requirements of customers, if the software is sold on a subscription basis.
