\chapter{Discussion and perspectives}
\label{ch:tool-eval}

In the previous chapter, I described the goal and the set-up of each experiment, and reported their findings.
These findings allow us to evaluate different features of the Sensei plugin, as well as its use in the paved path methodology.
In this chapter I summarise the findings, explain the lessons we learned and how they can affect the development of Sensei in the future.

Our findings and those of other research, show that customization of recipes can have a significant impact on the \gls{efp} rate, and hence the usability for the developer.
Using customized recipes results in a positive impact on the codebase since security issues are addressed truly as early as possible in the \gls{sdlc}.
If designed properly, applying the recipes regardless of context has minimal impact on performance, and helps improve code quality in many cases.

Security professionals report that creating these customized recipes with the recipe editor is easier than customizing rules of comparable tools.
Despite this, usability tests revealed that some features of the recipe editor can still be improved such as the templating language to reuse parts of the original code in a quick-fix.}
